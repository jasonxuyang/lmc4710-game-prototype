### Building for production:
The builds folder contains a production build folder. 
Replace this folder with a Unity WebGL buld when you want to release a new build to production.

If you want to store local builds on your machine, create a new folder named "Local" within the builds directory.
Store your local builds here, these builds will be ignored by git and won't be added to the remote repo.
